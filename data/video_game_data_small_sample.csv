"this was the first video game i ever bought for my psx and by far the more lasting fun. this game gives us the same fun we used to get back in the good old days with ""mario bros."",only way better. it takes us to different and colorful worlds that will keep us playing for hours and hours. the sound as well as the graphics are all pretty well made. it gets harder each time as your exitement gets higher. this game is a perfect example of what psx is all about. this game brought something different to the genre we know as ""adventure"".you'll get famirilized with each level because you'll have to develop your techniques and skills if you want to survive. if you want to experience pure fun just buy crash and all its sequels(i recommend 2,3 and team racing)and have fun playing as you never did!",5.0

"i have never played thief before but i'm a big fan of stealth games such as mgs and splinter cell, so i decided to give this a try. there are a few quirks that many reviewers have probably already mentioned, such as repetitive qte sections (opening windows, sliding through gaps in walls, etc) that mask load screens, lengthy load times, and the limited freedom in a seemingly open environment. also, some areas require you to press a button to drop down to the lower level, while some others do not. this type of inconsistency really took away the overall experience, which could have been much richer despite the detailed and atmospheric environments.

a side note: it took me just under 10 hours to complete the game in ""easy"" mode.

all in all, i enjoyed quite a bit of this game but i had hoped for more, and it had a potential to be a much better game. let's hope for a follow-up to this game that addresses the numerous minor issues. if you are a die-hard stealth fan, i would definitely recommend this. if you haven't played a lot of stealth games or don't enjoy slower-paced games, i would say probably do a rental or pass.",3.0

"the game is pretty fun when you get other people to play with you other than alone.  the wii zapper has a problem of ruining the nunchuck if you constantly mount and dismount it so just have one kept on there.  overall, it is a little awkward to have the trigger on the front instead of the rear.  if you want to aim better, sure, it works, but be prepared to buy a used nunchuck so you don't go through a new one.",3.0

"this game is pretty fun to play in between classes and during my astronomy lectures.  it has really good graphics and spells for a game boy.
the story seems to be overused and predictable.  and the dialogue is too long for such a linear game.  my favorite rpg's are planescape: torment, fallout 2, and arcanum for the computer.  these have lots of dialogue, but there are tons of choices to define your character and stuff.  this is just too linear to make us press b for all of the text.  and the yes and no in the text is pretty pointless too.  it all leads to the samething.
monster encounters happen to often (imho) and it can get really difficult.  but all in all it is a pretty good game for gba.",4.0
"in the witcher, you play a monster hunter mutated freak named geralt, who, for the record, is the farthest thing from sexy (he has white hair, weird eyes, and a giant scar) you can imagine. keep that in mind as you read this review.

first, despite being ""enhanced"" the game still had a major bug, at least for me. even with updated video drivers and a fully patched game, i was unable to see all the dialog options. but never fear, choosing dialog options that can majorly impact the flow of the game is unimportant, right?

when it comes down to it, how you do the killing is one of the most important parts of a game. the witcher uses the same engine as nwn2, so the action is relatively similar, except you don't have the same diversity in character development. to keep things interesting, you have to click at the right time to perform special sword combos, but this gets old real fast, and by the way clicking on an enemy while geralt is attacking will make the old unsexy freak stop attacking, so you have to pay attention or he'll just stand there and take a beating like a mutated human pinata.

the most frustrating thing is geralt's delay in attacking enemies. right after a cutscene or after zoning into an enemy lair, it takes geralt some time to draw his sword and properly target the right bad guy, which makes me very seriously question if the witcher's special ""mutagens"" gave him enhanced speed and reflexes or made him a bit lethargic. of course, because the game is based on the nwn2 engine, your character won't react like a normal action rpg, and honestly, the witcher is an action rpg. it isn't always a problem, but i'd like geralt to be a bit less sluggish when it counts. by the time you select the proper stance and enemy, the six armed men attacking you have already impaled you multiple times. so much for being a super-human, elite fighting force.

let's take a bit to talk about the ""sex card"" dynamic, a (censored) card geralt will receive after he ""does the dew"" with one of the game's female characters. geralt, let me remind you, is not at all sexy. not in anything he does. further, the whole ""feature"" feels like a cheap trick to get excitable teenage males to play the game. and again, geralt isn't sexy.

equally unimpressive, at least in my opinion, is the game's almost-required alchemy dynamic. picking leaves off plants to get enough ingredients so that my muscly hero can...brew things just isn't my cup of tea. sure, your home-made brews can give you incredible advantages in a fight, but if i wanted to pick plants i'd trim that weed that has grown to be the same size as my house and now calls himself marvin.

the game (other than geralt's scarred face and freaky cat-eyes) is very pretty, so having a machine that can handle the nice environments is definitely a must.

overall, the game is fun, but doesn't bring anything especially earth-shattering to the table. is it worth $50? nope, not at all, but then again i got it for $29.

oh, one final comment. they can invent mutagens that increase strength and reflexes, but they can't invent hair dye? some ""just for men"" and a pair of shades and a haircut might make geralt look presentable.",2.0

"in over 20 years, i've never seen a game provoke such diverse response as this one.  the five stars here reflect my reaction; you should not, i repeat not, use this as a gauge to whether =you= will like it.  there are some simple questions to ask yourself before plunking down your hard-earned cash.
first of all, how good is your mouse? seriously, i went from a good logitech wheel mouse to a cheap optical while playing this game and the optical mouse was dramatically better. i've also played it with different kinds of finger-pads, and with at least one (with the right mouse button on the side), the game is almost impossible.  i can't even imagine using a trackball (but i haven't tried, so i don't know for sure). b&w uses a revolutionary gesture recognition system which is great once you get to using it--but not if there's even a slight hitch with your pointing device.
second of all, how fast is your machine? b&w runs well on 800mhz, 32mb graphics card, 128mb ram--but game saves take quite a while and there are some jitters. i wouldn't even venture this on less than 600mhz.  smoothness is key.
these two points can't be over-stated. if your hardware is not up to snuff, b&w will frustrate you.  (some reports have it that any sort of ""odd"" hardware will make b&w mis-behave but i haven't seen this.) now, looking at the finer points:
what kind of gamer are you? b&w is not a fast-paced action game. there are some time constraints placed on you at various points, but mostly, b&w is more of an experience than a game in the traditional sense. if you're the kind of person who likes to ""beat"" computer games and drive toward the finish quickly, you won't get much out of this. if you can take pleasure out of the actions that you can do and the effects that these creates, you might find b&w very pleasing indeed.
in some ways, b&w feels like an adventure game. you have tremendous freedom to do what you want, but until you do certain things, the story isn't advanced.
are you a casual gamer? this is less important depending on how you answered the last question.  if you're a casual gamer who likes quake, you may find the learning curve not worth the return. i spent several sessions doing nothing but learning how to interact with the game. i found this process interesting, but if you've only got a half-hour every other day to play, and you favor quick results, this probably won't work for you. i did find that once i learned how to interact with the game, i could leave it for a week, come back and pick right up again, though, which makes it less involved (to my mind) than your average rpg or adventure game.
if you're a casual gamer and playing the game at a leisurely pace, i suspect that you won't find any of the bugs some people are complaining about. the more interesting question in some cases is ""is it a bug?"" i may have hit bugs while playing and just not recognized them.  b&w is that kind of game.
what pre-conceived notions do you have going in? back in '77 i was out of the country for a month, and when i came back everyone was talking about ""star wars"".  when i finally saw it, i was, of course, disappointed, since no movie could be =that= good. no game could be all that this has been hyped to be. worse for game author molyneux, people were expecting ""star wars"" from b&w and got ""dr. strangelove"".  (both great movies but =entirely= different experiences.)
the key thing to enjoying this game seems to be deliberate pacing. the longer you take on each level--training your creature, getting your skills up, mining the world for all it's worth--the more enjoyment you'll get out of it. you'll have fewer nasty surprises and you'll have a ""godlike"" understanding to go along with your ""godlike"" powers.
but that absolutely requires you to be able to enjoy the very action of playing, and for you to set your own goals that you can meet while discovering things about it. otherwise you'll just get bored or frustrated or angry.
hope this helps! above all, have fun! that's what it's all about!",5.0
"my previous mouse (razer naga) was failing me (as have all razer products i've ever owned), and they were wanting to send me a refurbished unit. no thanks. so i purchased this thing, since i didn't play any mmo anymore, no need for all those buttons.

i've been told a few times that it looks like a tank, and i would have to agree. it's made of very sturdy, hard plastic, and it fits nicely in the hand. to be clear though, this is a very large mouse. the pictures don't do it justice, but i could not see a small-handed person comfortably using this mouse. it's the largest mouse i've ever seen, even moreso with the pinky tray attached.

there are a few things i'm slightly unhappy with, though. the back/forward buttons on the side are very large. going from the naga, i'm used to everything being right at the tip of my finger. where there was 12 buttons on my old mouse, there is now 2. it's a night and day difference, especially considering on the naga the side buttons weren't the back/forward buttons (the ones on top were).

the precision button is pretty far up there, and if you position the side tray to comfortably position the back/forward buttons, the precision button requires you twist your wrist slightly or bend your thumb and move your whole hand up to reach. this pretty much makes it useless; isn't it suppose to be a convenient on-the-fly feature? well, it's not. luckily for me, i don't play first person shooters, so it makes a perfect play/pause button for various media players :)

out of the box, the thumb scroll is useless. you can bind it to left and right arrow keys for scrolling, or you can bind it to ctrl tab and ctrl shift tab to alternate between tabs quickly; but it's all up to you.

as for the software, it's less buggy than razer's software, but in both cases (theirs and razer's) the software is awful. it looks like a program that was made using a programming tutorial or something, and the ui is clunky with silly effects that just make the experience poor when things don't behave the way they do in every other program. i also prefer razer's macro recorder, which was exponentially easier to use.

overall, i'd suggest this mouse to anyone looking for a sturdy reliable mouse. if i have any problems with this mouse, i will be sure to update this review.",5.0
i enjoyed my collector's edition of ascension. it has the sweet price point of $79.99 when i purchased it.  i think that's the perfect spot for a collector's edition title.  it came with an awesome statue.  i have kratos sitting next to my ps3.  this version of gow seems a bit harder than the prior titles.  fun game overall :),5.0

"this is a great system and comes with everything you need to get started having fun, all the cords and controller are in the box and you can start installing halo right off the bat (it's a digital copy and you will have to do a somewhat lengthy install before you can start playing).

quick note about halo:mcc, you will have to update and install the game and you will also need to get an online account set up before you can play online (you'll also be subject you a large game patch that includes the multiplayer portion of the game via download -- 4 whole games on 1 disc is pretty epically huge). it's a great game series though and is totally worth picking up so you can take on the whole series. xbox works great and live is exceptional, it's never gone offline for me more than a few hours at a time and i find the services online to be more than worth the cost of a yearly xbox live gold fee (usd $60 yearly, or buy it on sale ((duh!"")) ).  also in signing up for xbox live gold you'll be getting 1-2 free downloadable games every month - some games are great some are just ok, but it's all free. :-)

i also recommend picking up some rechargeable duracell batteries for your controller, for about $10 you can get a set of 4 that will last both of your controllers for 2-3 years worth of use. great buy overall as it'll save you $$ down the line. i've had my xbox since launch day and have loved every minute of it.",5.0

"i bought this game without reading a single review. then i played it... for an entire weekend, only stopping when i absolutely had to sleep. this game is, at its core, everything i love about the civilization series: balancing the economy with science with diplomacy with defense (or aggression), steering your strategy to match conditions as the world is revealed and your situation changes, guiding your nation as it evolves from a small settlement to a world superpower.

two major differences in this version really stood out for me:

first, the hexagonal map: i really loved this. it makes combat and movement feel more natural and fair. there is no advantage to being diagonal versus orthogonal any more.

second, no more giant stacks of units: one unit per tile (with one or two exceptions). at first i was frustrated by this, but as i played on it raised some interesting logistical challenges, particularly when moving large armies. now terrain and route started to make a bigger difference. blockading happens more naturally. more forethought is required when escorting weak units. when engaging in combat i felt like i was playing a table-top board game: each piece and its position really mattered.

i should also mention that this is by far, bar none, the most beautiful civ yet, and maybe one of the prettiest games i've played in a while. the whole presentation is absolutely stunning.

it's also the most approachable civ ever, i think. i've found myself recommending this game to people who have never played civilization before as a good introduction to the series. the interface provides massive amounts of information in a very accessible way.

to me, all the other changes in the game are minor tweaks. some add depth, some make the game more approachable, some remove elements of previous editions. looking at the reviews on amazon, i notice there are players who compare the game to previous editions and don't like the changes. i was actually surprised by the amount of negativity. the civilization games have evolved and changed over the years, and while some players are looking for a refinement of the same core game, i bought civilization v looking for a new expression of the core civilization essence: the feeling that you are guiding a civilization from birth to the colonization of space, making decisions for your nation that take 10, 20 or 100 years to play out fully, being completely immersed to the point where you just play one more turn, one more turn, one more turn... and stay up way too late.

civ v really delivered for me. i love it.",5.0
"the controller works just fine as a controller, yet i do have a few issues with it. one being that the batteries that were supposed to be included were not indeed included. two being that the battery cover is overly difficult to remove without a key or some other sort of tool. three being that the ""motion control"" handles like i'm trying to play with my chin. four, and this one is a double edged sword, being that it will turn it's self off after a few minutes of inactivity, like let's say a cut scene, this is good as it saves battery life, but rather terrible when that cut scene leads straight into a boss battle, so if you know this going into the cut scene you can twitch a joy stick every few seconds to keep it awake but that wastes more battery life than just sitting there because your also sending a signal. so in conclusion this controller is worth it for the money as long as your buying it purely as just a wireless controller, and as long as you have rechargable batteries.",3.0

"what excitement had i to be able to pilot the ships of star trek, and to pick between the enterprise x-1, the enterprise ncc-1701, the enterprise ncc-1701a, the enterprise ncc-1701d, the reliant, the constitution, etcetera.

and indeed i was having fun, with the familiar sounds of people telling me things on board, and piloting the ship in to lock phasers on a target and attack.

but that's about where the fun ends.

the way this game is built feels and looks like something ten years older than it should be, even if the graphics are somewhat top-notch and nifty for 2006.  the menu is too simple to a degree that you cannot adjust many graphics options or controls.  even worse, you can't even see your controls.  and trial and error never seems to work in-game, unless you play through the dreadful tutorial which is overly slow and pointless, just to teach you the most basic functions one at a time, four or five things over a ten minute period, just to learn to accelerate or decelerate without the mouse.

i got so bored with the tutorial, i gave up after exploring the first planet.  then i skirmished.

i had absolutely no idea what was happening or why.

as the federation, i could pick four ships maximum in my skirmish fleet, but i could only command one at a time.  no idea if i can have the other ships slaved to mine, or if they have independent ai.  i'm pretty sure they can't fight on their own, because every time i played, my other ships did absolutely nothing until i scrolled to them and manually moved them about.

i don't even know exactly what to press to attack!  i'm pretty sure it's just to left-click, but i've had so many instances where i am literally meters away from an enemy ship, smashing the left-click mouse button feverishly, and seeing absolutely nothing happen, only to suddenly have my phasers open up on a completely different target.

the mere idea of playing with star trek ships was a worthy idea worth making a game out of.  but they just seemingly intentionally sabotaged it with nonexistent control help and stilted, clumsy movement, completely arbitrary actions, and a limit to only four sides: federation, klingon, romulan, borg.",1.0

"i didn't really have a problem with the game.  then again, i did like army of 2, so take from that what you will.  i will tell you the main reason why i did dig ao2, is the 2 player co-op.  i never played the solo story, which i am going to assume much of the fuss originated.  me and my brother usually kick the snot out of co-op games together, such as gow, ao2, and this game.

what i really dig about this game is you get to create your dude, fully customize him, etc.  you get to pick your weapons, much like ao2 but without the intricate customization.  furthermore, it even plays like gow and ao2, but without productive blind-fire, unless you are blind-firing close-quarters with a shotgun.  unlike ao2, using silencers and whatnot is actually useful.  me and my brother by the end of ao2 just went ahead with the pimped weapons and dropped our silencers because it made little difference in the gameplay.  having the option to go either way was good.  i'm more of the silent type anyhow.

i don't know what to say other than i really enjoyed the game.  the thermal vision somewhat skews the depth perception, almost like looking through a funky lens and... maybe as it should be, depending on how close the enemy is will determine if he picks up on the thermal scan or not.

really, the only big beef i have with vegas 2 was ""faux pause.""  i'm really surprised nobody mentioned it, but all pause does is bring up the menu while the game still runs in the background.  i considered that the utmost of pathetic, you pause and get up for a second, coming back to find you died.  it's sad to think you have to be in some kind of ""dead zone"" to pause the game.  this is where my rating comes from, since there is no kind of ""breaking from the game"" without the risk of a game over.

"i had imported demon's souls in april, and finished it 3 times since then. i have a long review below but if you want a few sentences here it is:

the game has an excellent atmosphere, great character customization, enjoyable combat, some unique online elements, but very little story and minimal npc interaction. it is also very unforgiving, but it is strangely addictive if you don't get frustrated easily. it takes about 40 hours in your first play through. it's not because the game is huge... it's because you'll die a lot and repeat a lot, which results in playing very cautiously (which also adds to the atmosphere).

***review***

demon's souls is an action rpg game with some unique online elements. i loved the game but i can also see why some people (even rpg lovers) might hate it. although i gave it 5 stars, i cannot say the game is for everyone. just read the paragraph at the end where i explain some game mechanics, and if it sounds frustrating to you then might want to try the game first before buying.
for me 3 things are very important for an rpg. a good story and well-developed characters, deep character customization, tactical and fun combat.

story

in ds, the people in different realms/worlds are possessed by demonic souls and you are to get rid of them. when you kill them you collect their souls and get more powerful and eventually fight against the final demon. that's basically it. the game has very little story and minimal amount of non player characters (npcs). there are about 15-20 npcs in total (including the merchants and blacksmiths), and most of them are located in a hub called nexus. furthermore, you can talk to them but there are no dialogue trees. they'll say 2-3 new sentences after each time you kill a demon boss, giving you some background about the setting. sometimes they'll initiate a sidequest, by asking you to find/do something. that's all.

if you are expecting something like mass effect or jrpgs in terms of story or dialogue this is not it. however, the game has a very dark and immersive atmosphere. it just sucks you in and makes up for its lack of story. also, sometimes new characters/enemies appear depending on world tendency (world tendency is something like an alignment that can change toward black or white), which provides replay value.

in sum, unlike most other rpgs, this is not a game that you play for the story. there is minimal story and dialogue, but the game has an excellent atmosphere which gives you the feeling of being alone and overwhelmed.

character customization

character customization is probably the most important aspect of an rpg and this is where the game shines. you start the game with a certain class you picked, but it doesn't restrict you. you can develop your stats in anyway you like and completely turn it into something else (kind of like oblivion). for example, weapons/armors have different stats requirements, but they are not restricted to classes. as long as your character meets the stats requirement you can use it. so you can mix and mash classes anyway you like. there are 8 different attributes, and when you level up you can raise one of those attributes by one point (there is room for up to 99 for each attribute).

weapon upgrades are done by using the ores you find. you can do regular upgrades (e.g. long sword +2) or you can change it into a different weapon (e.g. dragon long sword) depending on the ores you found. there are several different types of ores that opens a different upgrade branch. there are also some special upgrades, if you choose to use a demon's soul that you obtained from a boss, which will give you a unique weapon.

combat

the customization also affects your gameplay. for instance, you can wield double swords, sword and shield, sword and crossbow, sword and a wand, two shields (if you want to be fancy) etc. moreover, any sword can be wielded two handed or one handed. of course, if you choose to wield a two handed sword with one hand, you character becomes clumsy. if you choose to wield a one handed sword with two hands, then you make stronger attacks with different animations.

the combat is in real time and it is like an action game. in the controller, l1-l2 is assigned to the left hand, and r1-r2 is assigned to the right hand. l1 is used for guarding, l2 is either for parry (when wielding a shield) or attacking (weapon on left hand)). on the other hand, r1 is regular attack, and r2 is strong attack. you can also roll, run, but you cannot jump. so you end up having different combat gameplay and tactics depending on what you choose to equip.

online gameplay

if your ps3 is connected to the internet, you'll automatically play the game online. that lets you do different things. first, you'll see some messages left by other players. they can provide some clues, warnings etc. you can also leave messages but you can only create them by combining preset words and phrases. you cannot type whatever you want. and if someone finds your message helpful and rates it, then your health replenishes. second, you'll see pools of blood and if you touch them it will show you a ghost of some other player and how he/she died. it's just another clue to help you in the game.

third, and the most important one, is playing with/against others. if you are in body form, you'll see blue signs on the ground left by other players. by touching those signs you can summon up to two more people to your game and they'll fight along with you in your game helping you out. on the other hand, when you are in body form some other player can invade your game and try to kill you. if you are in soul form, then you can put a blue sign on the ground in order to be summoned by others or you can use an item to invade another player's game.  however, you cannot just invite your friends to your game. if you and your friends are on different servers (which you have no control over) you won't see the signs they left and will not be able to summon them. if you happen to be on the same server, you can arrange a location in the game to put the sign (via xmb message) and then summon the other person.

conclusion

in sum, demon's souls is one of the best games on ps3. it has a great atmosphere and addictive gameplay that makes you come back, even after you died for the tenth time in the same boss battle. unfortunately it is not a game for the impatient. just take a look at the cover art (the regular cover art which happens to be the deluxe edition cover in us release) of the game. you see a lone, battered knight, who is about to give up. that's demon's souls for you. if you are willing to take the challenge, victory will be very satisfying.

***about the difficulty and potential frustration***

first of all, the game is very unforgiving. even regular enemies can kill you with 1-2 blows, and they will kill you many times. however that's not the main issue. the real difficulty comes from not being able to save in the middle of a stage/map. the stages don't have checkpoints either. also dying is very costly. when you die, first you will drop your souls at the location you died (you gain souls by killing enemies, and souls are used as both experience points to improve your stats and also as money). then you will lose your body (which means losing half of your life bar, making the game even harder) and you will respawn in soul form at the start of the stage. however all the enemies will also respawn. furthermore, if you die again before reaching the location you died, you will lose all the souls you have dropped previously for good. that means no experience/no money from all that playing. also reaching your corpse does not give your body back, it only gives back your collected souls. you can gain your body (half of your life bar) if you beat a boss, or invade another player's game and kill him/her, or use a special item.

in brief, you will be playing the same stage from the beginning over and over again, until you beat the boss at the end of the stage. in a lot of cases, you will not gain any experience/level during this process, because you'll die a second time before reaching your corpse. however, the stages are not very big. it generally takes about 5 to 10 minutes to get to the boss if you know the way and if you don't die. a new respawn point appears at the end of the stage, after a boss is defeated. (the game has 5 worlds and each world has 4 stages/bosses). so, after you beat a boss you can spawn from that location if you want.

still, a lot of people would probably hate this no save/checkpoint mechanic combined with the games unforgiving difficulty. it's like 80s arcade games which takes you back to the beginning of the stage when you die.",5.0
i love it and well getting it again and also well tell others as well the best in the world,5.0
